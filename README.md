# Orient-Express

Another experimental site from way back in my learning days, and not a conventional website by any means.

However, it helped me to think about JS, semantic markup and the use of audio and video in HTML5. 

It also helped me to learn about layouts. The images and videos are my own, from my time living in Japan. 
Sadly, the videos are omitted due to space limitations on GitHub.
